Quantum computers have been in the works for [decades](https://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/wp-content/deutsch85.pdf). Given [recent advancements](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y), large sacle quantum machines may become a reality—possibly within the [next decade](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf). That’s a game-changer.

These machines can break modern cryptography. They can also speed up AI searches and simulate quantum systems for breakthroughs in drug discovery and energy. The potential is enormous, but so are the risks.

Quantum computers threaten cryptography mainly through two algorithms: [Shor's algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9508027) for factoring integers and solving discrete logarithms and [Grover's search](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605043), which can invert a black-box function. A breakdown in cryptography would expose government secrets, bank accounts, and more. If only a few players control quantum tech, they’ll hold incredible power over our digital world.

Quantum computing is expensive. For now, only well-funded companies or governments can invest heavily in it. This creates a power imbalance—similar to the early days of classical computing, where big corporations dominated. Over time, Moore’s law and open-source software made classical computing more accessible. We need that same shift in quantum computing.

Openness matters. We should endevour to realise quantum computing for the greater good with shared research and collaboration.

Quantum computing will reshape our world. But without open access and collaboration, it risks becoming a [tool for only a few](https://simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/NextWorld_Extra/92.09.Sept.NWE/92.09.Sept.NWExtra11.html).
