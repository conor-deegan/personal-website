### Thoughts on this ridiculous series

The good:

- Nice to see how these typical black box cloud services work under the hood.
- Definitely improved my Rust skills.
- Learnt a whole lot about the wonderful world of DNS.
- Hot take, once you know your TCP, sockets, and HTTP, building these services is not that hard.

The bad:

- I am not sure I am fully bought in to Rust yet. It's hard.
- Observability is key.

The ugly:

- I guess the whole thing is a bit ugly.

### Overall

Worth the time? Yes. Would I do it again? No. Would I recommend it? Yes, but only if you are a masochist.

Thanks, 
Conor
