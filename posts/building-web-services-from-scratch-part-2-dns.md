### Introduction

The aim of this post is to build a simple DNS server from scratch using Rust.

The final code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/conor-deegan/web-services).

Let's get started.

### Some scope

- I'm going to build an authoritative DNS server. This means that it will be responsible for a specific domain as it will host the domain's zone file.
- I'm going to build a simple DNS client to test the server.
- I am going to build a **very** simple DNS resolver which is responsible for querying the authoritative DNS server for a specific domain and caching the results for a specific TTL and then returning the IP address to the client.
- For now, the DNS server will only support A records. I may add support for MX records in the future.
- I am absolutely not going to write about the DNS protocol in detail, Google will do a much better job at that than me (this applies to almost every web service I will build).

### WTF is DNS?

Easy, it does this:

```
conordeegan.dev -> 104.21.79.122
```

How are DNS clients, resolvers and servers related?

- A DNS client is a device that makes DNS queries (e.g. a web browser).
- A DNS resolver is a server that queries authoritive DNS servers on behalf of a client. It caches the results for a specific TTL before querying the authoritative DNS server again.
- An authoritive DNS server is a server that responds to DNS queries from DNS resolvers. It ultimately converts domain names to IP addresses.

How hard can it be? ðŸ« 

### Authoritive DNS server

I am going to build a simple authoritive DNS server that will respond to DNS queries for a specific domain. The server will be responsible for hosting the domain's zone file hence *authoritative* DNS server.

The server will listen on port 53 for UDP packets. The server will parse the DNS query and respond with the IP address of the domain if it is found in the domain zone file, if it is not found it will respond with an NXDOMAIN (nonexistent domain) error.

The domain zone file I will use looks like:

```
example.com=192.0.2.1,3600
```

Where `example.com` is the domain name, `192.02.1` is the IP address, and `3600` is the TTL (time to live) in seconds.

I am cheating a bit here and in reality the zone file would contain a lot more information than this. However, for the purposes of this post, this will do and is close enough to the real thing.

The code is fairly self-explanatory so I will not go into too much detail but instead provide a high-level overview of the main parts.

We will need a function for parsing the domain zone file and storing the records in a HashMap.

```rust
async fn load_a_records_from_file(file_path: &Path) -> io::Result<HashMap<String, (Ipv4Addr, u32)>> {
    let file = File::open(file_path)?;
    let buf = io::BufReader::new(file);
    let mut a_records = HashMap::new();

    for line in buf.lines() {
        // Parsing each line to extract domain, IP address, and TTL.
        let line = line?;
        let parts: Vec<&str> = line.split('=').collect();
        if parts.len() == 2 {
            let domain = parts[0];
            let rest: Vec<&str> = parts[1].split(',').collect();
            if rest.len() == 2 {
                // Converting string IP to Ipv4Addr and string TTL to u32.
                let ip_address = rest[0].parse().map_err(|_| Error::new(io::ErrorKind::InvalidData, "Invalid IP address"))?;
                let ttl = rest[1].parse().map_err(|_| Error::new(io::ErrorKind::InvalidData, "Invalid TTL"))?;
                // Storing the parsed data in a HashMap.
                a_records.insert(domain.to_string(), (ip_address, ttl));
            }
        }
    }

    Ok(a_records)
}
```

This function is simple. It reads the domain zone file line by line, parses each line to extract the domain, IP address, and TTL, and stores them in a HashMap called `a_records`.

Next, we need a function to create a DNS response packet. This function takes the transaction ID, domain name, IP address, and TTL as input and returns a byte array representing the DNS response packet.

Note: The DNS response packet is a binary format that follows the DNS protocol. The format is well-defined and consists of various fields such as transaction ID, flags, questions, answer RRs (resource records), authority RRs, and additional RRs. The response packet is constructed by concatenating these fields in the correct order. The transaction ID is used to match the response to the original query. I have no intention of explaining the DNS protocol in detail, so I will leave it at that. I also have no shame in admitting that I used ChatGPT to help me with this function ðŸ¤–.

```rust
fn create_dns_response(transaction_id: [u8; 2], domain: &str, ip_address: Ipv4Addr, ttl: u32) -> Vec<u8> {
    let mut response = Vec::new();
    let ip_bytes = ip_address.octets();
    let ttl_bytes = ttl.to_be_bytes(); // Convert TTL to byte array in big-endian format

    // Transaction ID, Flags, Questions, Answer RRs, Authority RRs, Additional RRs
    response.extend_from_slice(&transaction_id);
    response.extend_from_slice(&[0x81, 0x80, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]);

    // Question section
    for label in domain.split('.') {
        response.push(label.len() as u8);
        response.extend_from_slice(label.as_bytes());
    }
    response.extend_from_slice(&[0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01]);

    // Answer section
    response.extend_from_slice(&[0xc0, 0x0c, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01]);
    response.extend_from_slice(&ttl_bytes);
    response.extend_from_slice(&[0x00, 0x04]);
    response.extend_from_slice(&ip_bytes);

    response
}
```

Up next, we need a function to parse the DNS query packet and extract the domain name from it. This function takes the buffer containing the DNS query packet and the starting position of the domain name in the buffer as input and returns the domain name as a string. The first 12 bytes of the DNS query packet contain the header information, so we skip those bytes and start parsing the domain name from the 13th byte.

```rust
fn parse_domain_name(buf: &[u8], start: usize) -> Result<String, &'static str> {
    let mut position = start;
    let mut domain_name = String::new();

    while position < buf.len() && buf[position] != 0 {
        let length = buf[position] as usize;
        position += 1; // move past the length byte

        // Check for potential out-of-bounds or invalid length
        if length == 0 || position + length > buf.len() {
            return Err("Invalid domain name in query");
        }

        if !domain_name.is_empty() {
            domain_name.push('.');
        }
        let label = match std::str::from_utf8(&buf[position..position + length]) {
            Ok(s) => s,
            Err(_) => return Err("Invalid UTF-8 label in domain name"),
        };
        domain_name.push_str(label);

        position += length; // move to the next label
    }

    Ok(domain_name)
}
```

Finally, we can put everything together in the main function. The main function will load the A records from the domain zone file, bind the server to UDP port 53, listen for incoming DNS queries, parse the domain name from the query, and send the appropriate DNS response back to the client.

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Load the A records from "src/domain.txt".
    let a_records = load_a_records_from_file(Path::new("src/domain.txt")).await?;

    // Bind the server to UDP port 53 and listens for incoming DNS queries.
    let socket = UdpSocket::bind("0.0.0.0:53").await?;
    println!("Listening on {}", socket.local_addr()?);

    let mut buf = [0u8; 512]; // Buffer to store incoming DNS queries.

    loop {
        let (len, addr) = socket.recv_from(&mut buf).await?;
        println!("Received query from {}", addr);

        match parse_domain_name(&buf, 12) { // Start parsing after the header
            Ok(domain) => {
                println!("Parsed domain: {}", domain);
                match a_records.get(&domain) {
                    Some((ip_address, ttl)) => {
                        let transaction_id = [buf[0], buf[1]];
                        let response = create_dns_response(transaction_id, &domain, *ip_address, *ttl);
                        if let Err(e) = socket.send_to(&response, &addr).await {
                            eprintln!("Failed to send response: {}", e);
                        } else {
                            println!("Sent response to {}", addr);
                        }
                    },
                    None => {
                        // Constructing NXDOMAIN response (using a lot of ChatGPT here)
                        let transaction_id = [buf[0], buf[1]];
                        let mut response = Vec::new();

                        // Transaction ID
                        response.extend_from_slice(&transaction_id);
                        response.extend_from_slice(&[0x81, 0x83]); // Note: 0x83 indicates NXDOMAIN
                        response.extend_from_slice(&[0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]);
                        response.extend_from_slice(&buf[12..len]);
                        if let Err(e) = socket.send_to(&response, &addr).await {
                            eprintln!("Failed to send NXDOMAIN response: {}", e);
                        } else {
                            println!("Sent NXDOMAIN response to {}", addr);
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to parse domain name: {}", e),
        }
    }

}
```

That's that ðŸ”¥ Now, you can run the authoritive DNS server using `cargo run` and test it by sending DNS queries to `127.0.0.1` on port 53. For example,

```bash
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 53 example.com
```

or using `nslookup`:

```bash
nslookup example.com 127.0.0.1
```

Weirdly, it works on first try...

### DNS Resolver I AM HERE!!!!!!

WIP. Middle man between client and server. Need to suss out ports to run it on. May need docker soon with docker-compose?

DO I NEED TO UPDATE THE DOMAIN FILE: I believe the ns ips are the same as the auth server. This may be needed for the resolver to work.

```
; Zone file for example.com
$TTL 3600
@    IN    SOA   ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
              2024040101 ; Serial
              7200       ; Refresh
              800        ; Retry
              86400      ; Expire
              3600 )     ; Negative Cache TTL

; Define the nameservers
@            IN    NS     ns1.example.com.
@            IN    NS     ns2.example.com.

; A records for nameservers
ns1          IN    A      192.0.2.1
ns2          IN    A      192.0.2.2

; A record for the domain
@            IN    A      198.51.100.1

; MX records for mail exchange
@            IN    MX 10  mail.example.com.
@            IN    MX 20  backup-mail.example.com.

; A record for mail servers
mail         IN    A      198.51.100.2
backup-mail  IN    A      198.51.100.3

; CNAME record for www
www          IN    CNAME  example.com.

; TXT record for SPF and other purposes
@            IN    TXT    "v=spf1 ip4:198.51.100.2 ~all"

; SRV record for SIP service
_sip._tcp    IN    SRV    10 5 5060 sipserver.example.com.

; A record for additional services
sipserver    IN    A      198.51.100.4
```

Explanation of Each Section
$TTL 3600: The Time To Live (TTL) value in seconds for DNS records, indicating how long a resolver should cache the DNS information.
SOA Record: Start of Authority record defines global parameters for the zone, including the primary nameserver, the email of the domain administrator, the domain serial number, and timers.
NS Records: Nameserver records that point to the authoritative nameservers for the domain.
A Records: Address records that map a domain name to an IP address.
MX Records: Mail exchange records that define the mail servers for accepting email on behalf of the domain.
CNAME Record: Canonical Name record that allows aliasing one domain name to another (the 'canonical' domain).
TXT Record: Text records used for various purposes, including SPF records to prevent email spoofing.
SRV Record: Service locator records used in identifying servers for specified services.
This file is a basic template, and the actual content might vary based on the specific needs of the domain, such as additional A records for subdomains, AAAA records for IPv6 addresses, or additional TXT records for DKIM or other verifications. Each record type serves a different purpose, and together, they control how traffic is directed for the domain across the internet.

In a DNS zone file, the combination of NS records and A records for nameservers serves a critical function in defining how a domain's DNS is managed and resolved.

NS Records: These specify the authoritative nameservers for the domain. The NS records within the zone file tell the rest of the internet which servers have the authoritative DNS information for the domain example.com. When a query is made for the domain, these NS records are checked to find out which server to ask for the definitive DNS information.

```
; Define the nameservers
@            IN    NS     ns1.example.com.
@            IN    NS     ns2.example.com.
```
In this example, ns1.example.com and ns2.example.com are declared as the nameservers for example.com. The "@" symbol represents the root or apex of the domain being configured, indicating these NS records are for the entire example.com domain.

A Records for Nameservers: These records map the nameserver hostnames to their respective IP addresses. Without these A records, the internet would not know how to find ns1.example.com or ns2.example.com because it wouldn't have their IP addresses.

```
; A records for nameservers
ns1          IN    A      192.0.2.1
ns2          IN    A      192.0.2.2
```

Here, ns1.example.com is mapped to the IP address 192.0.2.1, and ns2.example.com is mapped to 192.0.2.2. This mapping is essential for any external entity trying to resolve domain names under example.com because it tells them where to find the authoritative DNS servers for the domain.

The presence of both these types of records in a zone file is crucial for DNS resolution. The NS records define the servers responsible for the domain's DNS, while the A records for the nameservers provide the specific IP addresses needed to contact those servers. This setup ensures that when a lookup for example.com or any of its subdomains is performed, the query can be directed to the correct server based on the NS information and then reach that server using the IP address specified in the A record.

he process by which the internet finds the nameserver records for a domain is a fundamental aspect of how the Domain Name System (DNS) works. DNS is essentially the internet's phone book; it translates human-friendly domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of how the internet finds the nameserver records for a domain:

Root Nameservers: Every DNS lookup begins with a query to one of the root nameservers. The root zone acts as the top of the DNS hierarchy and contains pointers to the servers managing the Top-Level Domains (TLDs) like .com, .net, .org, etc. There are 13 sets of these root nameservers, identified by letters A through M, distributed globally and operated by various organizations.

TLD Nameservers: Once the query reaches a root nameserver, it is redirected to the TLD nameservers for the domain's TLD (for example.com, this would be the .com TLD nameservers). The TLD nameservers are responsible for managing all the domain names within that TLD and have records pointing to the authoritative nameservers for each domain.

Authoritative Nameservers: The TLD nameserver responds with the addresses of the domain's authoritative nameservers (the NS records for example.com, in this case). These are the servers that have the complete, authoritative DNS records for the domain.

A or AAAA Records: Finally, the authoritative nameserver is queried for the specific DNS record needed (such as an A record for an IPv4 address or AAAA for an IPv6 address). If the original query was to find the nameserver records themselves, this step would already be completed by reaching the authoritative nameservers.

Example Process:
A user wants to visit example.com.
Their computer queries a root nameserver, which directs the query to the .com TLD nameserver.
The .com TLD nameserver then points to the authoritative nameservers for example.com, as specified in its NS records.
The userâ€™s computer queries one of these authoritative nameservers for example.com's A record to find the IP address of the web server hosting example.com.
This hierarchical querying ensures that DNS lookups are efficiently directed from the most general level (the root) to the specific (the domainâ€™s authoritative nameserver), even if the initial query only knows the domain name. DNS caching at various levels, including the operating system, DNS resolvers, and routers, can significantly speed up this process by storing the results of previous lookups for a set period.

### DNS Client

WIP - simple cli app that takes in a domain, gets the ip via the resolver or auth domain if ttl is up, it then pings the returned ip using curl. Need to suss out ports to run it on. Can it take a path and method to ping with?
